# Tomato Classification for Quality Assessment Using CNN with Attention Mechanism

## Overview
This repository implements a **Tomato Classification System** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with an integrated attention mechanism. The project aims to assess the quality of tomatoes by accurately classifying them into various categories based on visual features.

### Research Highlights
- Utilizes CNN for feature extraction and attention mechanisms to enhance classification accuracy.
- Focuses on quality parameters such as size, ripeness, texture, and defects.
- Offers an efficient, automated solution for agricultural quality control processes.

### Features
- **CNN Architecture:** Deep convolutional layers for robust feature extraction from tomato images.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Ensures the model focuses on critical regions of the image for quality assessment.
- **Dataset:** High-quality labeled images of tomatoes representing various quality levels (ripe, unripe, damaged, etc.).
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Achieves high accuracy and precision for quality classification.

## Project Workflow
1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   - Collect and preprocess tomato images (resize, normalize, augment).  
   - Label images according to quality classes.

2. **Model Training:**  
   - Train a CNN with integrated attention layers.  
   - Use techniques like transfer learning and fine-tuning for better performance.

3. **Inference:**  
   - Test the trained model on unseen data for quality predictions.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Analyze model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
- Demonstrates high classification accuracy due to the attention mechanism's ability to focus on crucial tomato features.
- Achieves reliable and efficient quality assessment for potential integration into agricultural quality control pipelines.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multilingual Dataset:** Support for tomatoes from various geographic regions.  
- **Real-Time Applications:** Integration with IoT devices for real-time quality control.  
- **Explainability:** Visualizing attention maps for interpretability.
